# Kokkos Mini-Apps Repository

This repository contains example mini-applications that have been written using the Kokkos programming model. These mini-apps can be used as examples and performance comparisons against other models.

This repository only contains miniApps which do not have Kokkos versions in their originators repository on github. 
There are more Kokkos versions of miniApps on github in the following repositories:

* MiniMD, a molecular dynamics code: https://github.com/Mantevo/miniMD
* ExaMiniMD, a moelcular dynamics code (successor to MiniMD): https://github.com/ecp-copa/ExaMiniMD
* MiniFE, a unstructured finite elements: https://github.com/Mantevo/miniFE
* MiniAero, a unstructured finite elements (more complex than MiniFE): https://github.com/Mantevo/miniAero
* Snap, discrete ordinates neutral particle transport: https://github.com/UoB-HPC/SNAP-Kokkos
* TeaLeaf, heat conduction unassembled solve: https://github.com/UoB-HPC/TeaLeaf-Kokkos
* KHPCG, MultiGrid Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Solve, part ot Top500 benchmarks: https://github.com/hpcg-benchmark/KHPCG3.0
